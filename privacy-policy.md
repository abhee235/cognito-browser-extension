## Privacy Policy for Cognito Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** April 6, 2025

Thank you for using Cognito! We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent experience. This Privacy Policy explains how Cognito handles your data.

**What Data We Collect:**

Cognito is designed to enhance your web Browse experience without collecting your personal information for our own purposes.

* **Website and Video Content:** To provide features like summarization and translation, Cognito may access and process the content of the web pages you visit and the YouTube videos you watch. This processing is solely for the purpose of delivering the requested functionality to you.

**How We Use Your Data:**

The data Cognito accesses is used exclusively to provide you with the features you request:

* **Summarization:** We analyze the content of web pages and videos to generate concise summaries.
* **Translation:** We process text on web pages to translate it into your desired language.
* **Writing Assistance:** If you use writing assistance features, the text you provide will be processed to generate suggestions.

**Your Choices and Control:**

Cognito offers you control over how your data is processed:

* **Ollama Integration (Local Processing):** If you choose to use Cognito with Ollama, all processing of your data by the Large Language Model (LLM) occurs locally on your computer. This means your data never leaves your device, providing the highest level of privacy and security.
* **Third-Party LLM Services (Optional):** Cognito also supports integration with third-party LLM services like Groq (for Llama 70B), Google Gemini, and ChatGPT. If you opt to use these services, the content you wish to summarize, translate, or use for writing assistance will be sent to their respective servers for processing. Please review the privacy policies of these third-party providers for information on how they handle your data. (Links to their privacy policies should be provided within the extension's settings or documentation).
* **No Personal Data Collection for Our Use:** We want to explicitly state that we do not collect any personal information from you, such as your Browse history, search queries, or any other personally identifiable data, for our own tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

**Data Sharing:**

We do not share any of your personal information with third parties because we do not collect it. If you choose to use third-party LLM services, the data you process through Cognito using those services will be subject to their respective privacy policies.

**Data Retention:**

Any website or video content processed by Cognito is typically done in real-time to provide the requested feature. We do not retain this data on our servers. If you are using a third-party LLM, their data retention policies will apply to the data processed by them.

**Security:**

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. When you use Cognito with local processing via Ollama, your data remains entirely on your device. When using third-party services, we encourage you to review their security practices.

**Children's Privacy:**

Cognito is a general-purpose browser extension and does not specifically target children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy:**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised.

**Contact Us:**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/abhee235/cognito-browser-extension/issues) on our GitHub repository.

**By using Cognito, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.**
